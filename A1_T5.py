#Make a Python program which can take user inputs and convert them into integers.


#Print “Calculate the area of a wall.”
print("Calculate the area of wall.")
#Prompt user
#“Enter the width in meters: ”
Feed = int(input("Enter the width in meters: "))
#Store the input value into Feed variable.

#Convert the Feed variable into an integer and store it in Width variable
Width = Feed
#Prompt user

#“Enter the height in meters: ”
Height = int(input("Enter the height in meters: "))
#store the input value into Feed variable.

#Convert the Feed variable into an integer and store it in Height variable

#Print “Width is {Width} m and height is {Height} m.”
print("Width is",Width,"m and height is",Height,"m.")
#Multiply Width and Height, then store the result in Area variable
Area = Width * Height
#Display results to the user: “The wall will be {Area} square meters.”
print("The wall will be",Area,"square meters.")
#Try the program with different inputs e.g. decimals. Notice any problems in the program? Are you able to solve the issue?


#The test environment(GitHub Classroom) may run your code multiple times with different integer values.
